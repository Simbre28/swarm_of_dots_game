Swarm of dots
---------------------

- the mouse controls a dot that acts liek a shooting star..
- in a space like tech/ / code lik eenvironmnmet
- the aim of the game is to "hide" or "runaway from other dots... that when they touch you you die in th egame
- the game will over tim eincrease in speed and amount of dots, and type of dots that do other things, such as pull you in like  magnetism
- it will kinda represent space with gravity elements of gravity
- there will be oher areas that you can stay in a safe zone.. like the atmostphere of a blue planet that appears floating through space
- there will be other areas that are more dangerous like star or sun like or unsable planets

the vibe will be like you are a shooting star, tring not to get pulled into a plannets atmostphere (frindly one)
